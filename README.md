# Hi there, welcome to ðŸ‘‘YudSwin profileðŸ‘‘
**Junior (Designer/Developer)**

I'm Duy and I study Computer Science at "[IU][wikipedia]" - Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City. I'd like to work as a software engineer.
I enjoy delving deeply into game design, level design, and game production as they apply to various types of problems. When working in the gaming industry, I believe it is critical to have a broad range of kn owledge in order to be prepared for anything.
Thank you for stopping by my GitHub page.
